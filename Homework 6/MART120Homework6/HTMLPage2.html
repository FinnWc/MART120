		<hl>Impressive Short Story Written by chatGPT about a Hippo learning to create its first website:</hl>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<hl>Once upon a time, in a lush African jungle, there lived a hippopotamus named Henry. Henry was a curious and adventurous hippo who loved to learn new things. One day, as he was lounging by the river, he overheard a group of birds talking about creating their own website. 
		Henry was intrigued. He had heard about websites before but had never seen one. He asked the birds what a website was and how one could create it. The birds explained that a website is a digital platform where one can share information, and that one can create it using a programming language called HTML. 
		Henry was determined to learn how to create a website. He asked the birds to teach him HTML, and they were happy to oblige. The first lesson was about HTML tags. The birds showed Henry how to use the <html> tag to define the document type, the <head> tag to add metadata, and the <body> tag to add content.
		Henry was a quick learner, but he was a little clumsy with his large hooves. He kept accidentally pressing the wrong keys on the keyboard. The birds patiently guided him and helped him correct his mistakes.
		As Henry progressed through the lessons, he got more and more excited about creating his website. He started thinking about what he wanted to share with the world. He decided to create a website about his favorite subject: the river.
		Henry spent hours working on his website. He added pictures of the river, wrote about its history and wildlife, and even added a page about his own adventures in the river. The birds helped him with the more complicated coding, and Henry soaked up all the knowledge like a sponge. 
		Finally, after days of hard work, Henry's website was ready. He proudly showed it to the birds, and they were impressed. They helped him publish it online, and Henry was overjoyed to see his website live on the internet. 
		From that day on, Henry spent his days lounging by the river and updating his website. He became a bit of a celebrity in the jungle, and animals from far and wide came to learn from him about the river. And all of this was possible because Henry had the curiosity and determination to learn something new.</hl>
